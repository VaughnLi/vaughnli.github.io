<p>2021-05-19</p>

<p>Hey would you look at that - my personal blog has been redesigned <em>again</em>! Although I am still using good ol’ Jekyll for the backend, I have now added a more fleshed-out CSS design which also includes a set of open source custom typefaces.</p>

<p><strong>Gasp!</strong> “How <em>could</em> you?!” I hear you ask. Let me explain.</p>

<h2 id="personal-sites-should-feel-personal">Personal sites should feel personal</h2>

<p>I can see how this change might seem hypocritical (it took some convincing myself) but I decided to follow in to footsteps of Kev Quirk and <a href="https://kevq.uk/adding-some-whimsy-character/">added a little whimsy and character</a> to my website. After all, personal websites should <em>feel personal</em>. My obsession with barebones HTML &amp; CSS serves its purpose on other public projects, but seems limiting for my own little space on the interwebs.</p>

<h2 id="banned-from-my-own-club">Banned from my own club</h2>

<p>I had originally converted this blog’s design to use <em>zero</em> CSS and instead rely solely on default browser styling. The main reasoning for doing so, was to have the ability to include my own personal website in the <a href="https://xhtml.club">XHTML Club</a> project. (I never said it was a <em>good</em> reason)</p>

<p>After giving it some thought, I’ve decided that this limitation seemed too extreme even for me.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>

<p>I know I always say “With this new design, I can finally focus on just writing content!” - but this is a lie. I’ll probably be fiddling with my personal website until the day I die. The good news is that I <em>do</em> have a few tutorial blog posts lined up to publish soon - so be on the lookout for those!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading through my pointless ramblings about personal websites. It’s good to just vent about these things sometimes…</p>
