<p>2024-09-20</p>

<p>I recently began the process of setting up my self-hosted<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <code>cgit</code> server as my main code forge. Updating repos via <a href="/wiki/cgit/">cgit on NearlyFreeSpeech</a> on its own has been simple enough, but it lacked the “wow-factor” of having some sort of automated build process. I looked into a bunch of different tools that I could add to my workflow and automate deploying changes. The problem was they all seemed to be fairly bloated or overly complex for my needs.</p>

<p>Then I realized I could simply use <code>post-receive</code> hooks which were already built-in to <code>git</code>! You can’t get more simple than that…</p>

<p>So I thought it would be best to document my full process. These notes are more for my future self when I inevitably forget this, but hopefully others can benefit from it!</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before We Begin</h2>

<p>This “tutorial” assumes that you already have a <code>git</code> server setup. It shouldn’t matter what kind of forge you’re using, so long as you have access to the <code>hooks/</code> directory and have the ability to write a custom <code>post-receive</code> script.</p>

<p>For my purposes I will be running standard <code>git</code> via the web through <code>cgit</code>, hosted on NearlyFreeSpeech (FreeBSD based).</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Here is a quick rundown of what we plan to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write a custom <code>post-receive</code> script in the repo of our choice</li>
  <li>Build and deploy our project when a remote push to <code>master</code> is made</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing crazy. Once you get the hang of things it’s really simple.</p>

<h2 id="prepping-our-servers">Prepping Our Servers</h2>

<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty, there are a few items we need to take care of first:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your main <code>git</code> repo needs <code>ssh</code> access to your web hosting (deploy) server. Make sure to add your public key and run a connection test first (before running the <code>post-receive</code> hook) in order to approve the “fingerprinting”.</li>
  <li>You will need to <code>git clone</code> your main <code>git</code> repo in a private/admin area of your deploy server. In the examples below, mine is cloned under <code>/home/private/_deploys</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Once you do both of those tasks</strong>, continue with the rest of the article!</p>

<h2 id="the-post-receive-script">The post-receive Script</h2>

<p>I will be using my own personal website as the main project for this example. My site is built with <a href="https://git.btxx.org/wruby">wruby</a>, so the build instructions are specific to that generator. If you use Jekyll or something similar, you will need to tweak those commands for your own purposes.</p>

<p>Head into your main <code>git</code> repo (<em>not</em> the cloned one on your deploy server), navigate under the <code>hooks/</code> directory and create a new file named <code>post-receive</code> containing the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

# Get the branch that was pushed
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
    branch=$(echo $ref | cut -d/ -f3)
    if [ "$branch" == "master" ]; then

        echo "Deploying..."

        # Build on the remote server
        ssh user@deployserver.net &lt;&lt; EOF
            set -e  # Stop on any error
            cd /home/private/_deploys/btxx.org
            git pull origin master
            gem install 'kramdown:2.4.0' 'rss:0.3.0'
            make build
            rsync -a build/* ~/public/btxx.org/
EOF

        echo "Build synced to the deployment server."
        echo "Deployment complete."
    fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s break everything down.</p>

<p>First we check if the branch being pushed to the remote server is <code>master</code>. Only if this is true do we proceed. (Feel free to change this if you prefer something like <code>production</code> or <code>deploy</code>)</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">if [ "$branch" == "master" ]; then
</code></pre>

<p>Then we <code>ssh</code> into the server (ie. <code>deployserver.net</code>) which will perform the build commands and also host these built files.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh user@deployserver.net &lt;&lt; EOF
</code></pre>

<p>Setting <code>set -e</code> ensures that the script stops if any errors are triggered.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">set -e  # Stop on any error
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we navigate into the previously mentioned “private” directory, pull the latest changes from <code>master</code>, and run the required build commands (in this case installing gems and running <code>make build</code>)</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /home/private/_deploys/btxx.org
git pull origin master
gem install 'kramdown:2.4.0' 'rss:0.3.0'
make build
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, <code>rsync</code> is run to copy just the build directory to our public-facing site directory.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">rsync -a build/* ~/public/btxx.org/
</code></pre>

<p>With that saved and finished, be sure to give this file proper permissions:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod +x post-receive
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>

<h2 id="time-to-test">Time to Test!</h2>

<p>Now make changes to your main <code>git</code> project and push those up into <code>master</code>. You should see the <code>post-receive</code> commands printing out into your terminal successfully. Now check out your website to see the changes. Good stuff.</p>

<h2 id="still-using-sourcehut">Still Using sourcehut</h2>

<p>My go-to code forge was previously handled through sourcehut, which will now be used for mirroring my repos and handling mailing lists (since I don’t feel like hosting something like that myself - yet!). This switch over was nothing against sourcehut itself but more of a “I want to control all aspects of my projects” mentality.</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful and please feel free to reach out with suggestions or improvements!</p>
