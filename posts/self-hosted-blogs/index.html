<p>2018-10-18</p>

<p>I remember a time on the internet<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> when everyone and their grandmother was running a personal blog. And I mean <em>personal</em> - not hosted on some side platform or a tacked-on addition to the rest of their website.</p>

<p>Nowadays companies and individuals alike use platforms like Medium to host and promote all of their articles, essays and case studies. I understand the draw, and can even list out the positives:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A large community already exists under the Medium brand</li>
  <li>It’s easy to promote your own work and follow others</li>
  <li>The platform is fairly easy to setup and implement</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately this has had a pretty severe impact on the blogging community as a whole - no one controls their own blogs anymore. I remember when finding a new blog was an interesting and fun experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how did they decide to layout the page design?</li>
  <li>what typefaces have they decided to use?</li>
  <li>what back-end are they using?</li>
  <li>how does it look and feel on mobile?</li>
</ul>

<p>These custom self-hosted blogs inspired other developers and designers to create their own blogs or tweak current ones. In a way it was a small factor in pushing what we could do on the web further and further, as designers engaged in friendly competition trying to one-up each others’ creations.</p>

<p>I also believe this inspired people to write better content instead of opting for clickbait garbage in order to get “featured” or boosted promotion on the main blogging platform. But I don’t even think that’s the worst to come of this mass-migration to a singular blogging platform.</p>

<p>All<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> blogs look identical now. I’m not sure if that was Medium’s intention, but either way I personally think it’s horrible. The individual personality of most design and development blogs has been completely stripped away.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m just a salty designer with a narrow-minded, pessimistic view on where our blogging communities seem to be heading - or maybe I just have higher standards.</p>
