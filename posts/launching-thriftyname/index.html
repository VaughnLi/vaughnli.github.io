<h1 id="thriftyname-5-brand-names">ThriftyName: $5 Brand Names</h1>

<p>2021-02-25</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve written anything on this blog, but for good reason - <strong>I’ve been working on a handful of side projects</strong>. I plan to drip-feed release these projects over time, but for today I’m announcing <a href="https://thrifty.name">ThriftyName</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-thriftyname">What is ThriftyName?</h2>

<p>In case this post title wasn’t clear enough (or you avoided going to the product site itself) ThriftyName is a place where indie devs, start-ups or entrepreneurs can go to get a custom brand name for <strong>just $10</strong>.</p>

<p>This “service” started out as an almost gimmicky joke in my head, but once I began building out the main website I realized that this could be quite useful for cash-strapped indies. After all, not all developers <em>love</em> to sit around wasting precious time thinking about product names, when they could use that time to <em>build their product</em>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-more">Learn More</h2>

<p>If you’re really interested in the reasoning behind making this project, check out the <a href="https://thrifty.name/#about">official about page on the site itself</a>. I go into a little more depth about my thought process.</p>

<h2 id="more-side-projects-incoming">More Side Projects Incoming…</h2>

<p>Like I said at the beginning of the post, keep a look out for my other side projects that I’ll be rolling out slowing. I’m still not sure of the best “method” to do this (release one every week? every month?) - but I’ll figure it out as I go along.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
