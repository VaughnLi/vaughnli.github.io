<h1 id="blogging-for-7-years">Blogging for 7 Years</h1>

<p>2023-06-24</p>

<p>My <a href="/aui">first public article</a> was posted on June 28th 2016. That was <em>seven</em> years ago.</p>

<p>In that time, quite a lot has changed in my life both personally and professionally. So, I figured it would be interesting to reflect on these years and document it for my own personal records. My hope is that this is something I could start doing every 5 or 10 years (if I can keep going that long!). This way, my blog also serves as a “time capsule” or museum of the past…</p>

<p><strong>This Blog</strong>:</p>

<p>I originally started blogging on <code>bradleytaunt.com</code> using WordPress, but since then I have changed both my main domain and blog infrastructure multiple times. At a glance I have used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jekyll</li>
  <li>Hugo</li>
  <li>Blot</li>
  <li>Static HTML/CSS</li>
  <li><a href="https://phpetite.btxx.org">PHPetite</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://shinobi.btxx.org">Shinobi</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pblog.btxx.org">pblog</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://barf.btxx.org">barf</a> <em>Currently using!</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal:</strong></p>

<p>As with anyone over time, the personal side of my life has seen the biggest <em>updates</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Married the love of my life (after knowing each other for ~14 years!)</li>
  <li>Moved out into rural Ontario for some peace and quiet</li>
  <li>Had three wonderful kids with said wife (two boys and a girl)</li>
  <li>Started noticing grey sprinkles in my stubble (I guess I can officially call myself a “grey beard”?)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Professionally:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pivoted heavily into UX research and design for a handful of years (after working mostly with web front-ends)</li>
  <li>Recently switched back into a more fullstack development role to challenge myself and learn more</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nothing-special">Nothing Special</h2>

<p>This post isn’t anything ground-breaking but for me it’s nice to reflect on the time passed and remember how much can change in such little time. Hopefully I’ll be right back here in another 7 years and maybe you’ll still be reading along with me!</p>
