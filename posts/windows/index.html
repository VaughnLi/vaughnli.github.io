<h1 id="setting-up-jekyll-on-windows">Setting Up Jekyll on Windows</h1>

<p>2022-09-02</p>

<p>I’ve recently been playing around with using Windows 10 as my daily operating system. So far, it has been going fairly well. Nothing will probably ever feel as “optimized” as running a Linux-based system but it works well for my current needs. Getting a Jekyll development environment setup was a different story though…</p>

<p>One of the first issues with using Windows 10 is the need to run a few of my open source projects that are built off Jekyll locally. This process initially seemed a like complex process to get things running smoothly but in the end was very straightforward. The main issue came from needing to bounce around through a handful of separate tutorials to get everything running smoothly.</p>

<p>So, I thought I would make this quick write-up to help those in the same situation (or even for my future self the need arises). Let’s get into it.</p>

<h2 id="wsl">WSL</h2>

<p>The first step involves installing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL</a> in order to run Linux alongside the main Windows OS. The documentation is well written and will get you up-and-running in no time. For quick reference, it essentially comes down to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Opening PowerShell or Command Prompt as an administrator</li>
  <li>Installing via the command: <code>wsl --install</code></li>
  <li>Restarting your machine after the install completes</li>
  <li>Creating your UNIX username and password</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="installing-ruby--dependencies">Installing Ruby &amp; Dependencies</h2>

<p>Once logged into your UNIX terminal session (with your created user) you can begin installing everything we need for Jekyll to work properly. The first step is to installing <code>rvm</code> and the <a href="https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm">official project documentation</a> does a very good job of walking you through this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure dependencies as installed: <code>sudo apt-get install software-properties-common</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the PPA and install the package:</p>

    <p>sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install rvm</p>
  </li>
  <li>Add your existing user to the <code>rvm</code> group: <code>sudo usermod -a -G rvm $USER</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to close and restart your session to your Ubuntu system for these changes to take. After that, we can use <code>rvm</code> to install the latest version (at this time of writing) of ruby:</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 3.1.2
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<h2 id="jekyll---finally">Jekyll - Finally!</h2>

<p>The final step is to update our gems and install Jekyll:</p>

<pre><code>gem update
gem install jekyll bundler
</code></pre>

<p>Once complete you can now run your Jekyll projects locally through WSL! Nothing ground-breaking but still pretty helpful for first-time users. And best of all, at least I have a good reference point in the future if I ever run into this issue again!</p>
