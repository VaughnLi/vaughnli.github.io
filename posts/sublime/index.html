<p>2023-04-13</p>

<p>Everyone seems to be running some version of VSCode as their main editor these days. But not me. I find VSCode to be too bloated for my needs - not to mention being built on top of electron instead of <em>native</em> code. I prefer running programs that don’t try to devour all of my machine’s available memory or spike my CPU.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: It’s important to remember my personal machine is a ThinkPad X201 with only 6GB of RAM (plan to upgrade to 8GB soon!). Obviously your mileage may vary if you’re using a beefier laptop or desktop…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case the title of this post didn’t make this obvious, my editor of choice is Sublime Text. It’s fast, has a robust plugin ecosystem, and a very friendly community of users. Because of its popularity, troubleshooting any issues you might encounter becomes much easier with the amount of information freely available online.</p>

<p>The only minor downside is that it isn’t <em>fully</em> open source. Personally, I think it is well worth buying a license directly from the developers to support their efforts.</p>

<p>If you haven’t played around with it yet, I highly recommend giving it a try. At the very least, I guarantee you’ll be impressed with the editor’s performance and speed! <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Sublime is precompiled against glibc and Alpine uses musl. This makes things a little difficult. Luckily we can get around this roadblock by falling back on flatpak (which is unfortunately still locked at version 3 for Sublime).</p>

<p>You’ll need to install flatpak, give your current user permission to install flatpak apps, and then install Sublime.</p>

<p>(The following snippets assume you are using <code>doas</code>. If you are using <code>sudo</code>, be sure to swap accordingly)</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">apk add flatpak
adduser &lt;YourUsername&gt; flatpak
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
</code></pre>

<p>Congrats. You now have setup <code>flatpak</code> on your machine! Next we install Sublime Text:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">flatpak install flathub com.sublimetext.three
</code></pre>

<p>You could stop now and simply open Sublime anytime by running the following command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">flatpak run com.sublimetext.three
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly fine but I find it a little cumbersome. I would much rather open my programs directly through dmenu. Let’s set that up.</p>

<h2 id="creating-system-links">Creating System Links</h2>

<pre><code class="language-sh">doas ln -s ~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/bin/com.sublimetext.three /usr/bin/sublimetext
</code></pre>

<p>Now that those directories are linked, simply open dmenu and start typing <code>sublimetext</code>. Done and done. No more terminal commands needed to open Sublime!</p>

      <p>I am aware that using a terminal-based editor such as vim or emacs would be even <em>more</em> efficient. For my own personal use I find more classical “IDE” applications to work best for me. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
