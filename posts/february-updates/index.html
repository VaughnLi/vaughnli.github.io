<h1 id="february-2022-update">February 2022 Update</h1>

<p>2022-02-23</p>

<p>It’s been a little quiet around here lately and for good reason: my wife gave birth to our third child last Thursday. Her name is Harmony and she was born in the late afternoon weighing in at 7 pounds 8 ounces.</p>

<p>Besides the lack of sleep, everything has been going very well and our boys are happy to finally have their sister “out” in the real world. She caught a small cold at the beginning but soldiered through it well.</p>

<p>As for personal life / work life, I’ve taken a couple weeks off until Harmony is in a bit more of a routine to make transitioning back to full time easier. I still have a few articles in the works (like setting up a T60 Thinkpad with Linux Mint and using FreeBSD for the first time on an EOL Chromebook) but those will come in time.</p>

<p>I guess I should get back to being a proper dad (I’m writing this on my phone as she sleeps on me and the boys are napping) but I’ll be back here posting stupid things in no time.</p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>
